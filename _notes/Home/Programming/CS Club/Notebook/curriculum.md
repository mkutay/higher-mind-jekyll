explain what exercise is and what problem is

exercise: calculate $5436^3$ without using a calculator

problem: calculate $\frac{1}{1\times2}+\frac{1}{2\times3}+\frac{1}{3\times4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{99\times100}$

in computer science or computer olympiad it is similar 

exercise: write a program to get a string and only output the odd indexed chars

    the code is simple but to find the solution you have to think, the proof of it
    
    you can use this problem to explain wishful thinking

- 1st step: orientation

A few things need to be done at the beginning of every problem.

- Read the problem carefully. Pay attention to details such as positive vs. negative, finite vs. infinite, etc.
- Begin to classify: is it a ‚Äúto find‚Äù or ‚Äúto prove‚Äù problem? Is the problem similar to others you have seen?
- Carefully identify the hypothesis and the conclusion.
- Try some quick preliminary brainstorming:
    - Think about convenient notation.
    - Does a particular method of argument (see Section 2.3) seem plausible?
    - Can you guess a possible solution? Trust your intuition!
    - Are there key words or concepts that seem important? For example, might prime numbers or perfect squares or infinite sequences play an important role?
- 2nd step: get your hands dirty
    - Plug in lots of numbers. Keep playing around until you see a pattern. Then play around some more, and try to figure out why the pattern you see is happening. It is a well-kept secret that much high-level mathematical research is the result of low-tech ‚Äúplug and chug‚Äù methods.
    - 1. The great Carl Gauss,
    widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians in history (see page 64), was a big fan of
    this method. In one investigation, he painstakingly computed the number of integer solutions to $*ùë•^2 + ùë¶^2 ‚â§ 90000*$
    - penultimate step: Once you know what the desired conclusion is, ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat will yield the conclusion in a single step?‚Äù Sometimes a penultimate step is ‚Äúobvious,‚Äù once you start looking for one. And the more experienced you are, the more obvious the steps are.
- 3rd step: wishful thinking and make it easier
