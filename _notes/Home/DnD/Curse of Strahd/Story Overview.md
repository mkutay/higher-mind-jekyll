# Story Overview

Barovia: a mysterious realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by **Strahd von Zarovich**. Using a deck of **tarokka cards** to predict their future, a fortune teller named **Madam Eva.**

Town of Vallaki: Stands ready against the servants of Strahd.

Town of Krezk: Lies near the edge of Strahd’s domain.

Village of Barovia: Most oppressed, locals have succumbed to despair, under the **Castle Ravenloft**.

# The Lands of Barovia

- A creature that runs to the fog must succeed on a DC 20 cons saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion, until they are out of the fog.
- You cannot leave the land of Barovia. No magic works. Unless you are a Vistani.

## Barovians

- Deeply invested in their homes and their traditions (they are from different ethnic backgrounds). They are wary of strangers. They stare openly, in silence, thereby expression their disapproval of anything. They are not talkative. If you make a friend with one, you are friend for life.
- There are so many people that soul number cannot handle. No soul can enter or leave. It sometimes takes decades to be newborn. That’s why Tatyana and Ireene Kolyana looks similar. Ones who don’t have souls cannot be distinguished from the real ones, although they are more depressed and don’t have much imagination. Ireena Kolyana and her brother Ismark and Vistani’s have **souls**. Rest is up to the DM. Strahd can tell the difference and drinks the blood of people that have souls. Soulles Barovians fade away when they cross the valley.

## Vistani

- Wanderers who live outside civilization. They build their in horse-drawn, barrel-topped wagons called **vardos** to travel. They are like human, they laugh hard, they wear bright clothes… They can leave the valley. Banishment is worse than death itself for them (they can be banished if they bring harm or misfortune).
- Strahd uses somee Vistani to do his dark deeds. The information they give about Strahd is simple garbage. They try to sell their potion (you can get across the fog with it, a lie) for so much money.
- The characters can learn the following if they earn a Vistana’s trust.
    - Strahd von Zarovich
