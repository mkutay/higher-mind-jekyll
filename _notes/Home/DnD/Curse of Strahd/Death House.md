[[Eldon Quickpuff [[(Deniz)]]]] jumps down from a portal downwards. He is surrounded by a man and a guard. He has brightly colored clothes that are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew. “I have been sent to find you and deliver you a letter. If you are a real man with honor, you will come to my maaaster’s aid at first instant. You should take the west road from here and go to Svalich Woods. After that you will find my maaaster in the Village of Barovia.” He leaves. The crest you don’t recognize. 2

[[Aelin Galathynius (Celaena [[Sardothien)]]]]: Later in the night while you are going to sleep, the door knocks on your home. A man all wet appears, asking for a help, saying “I am so sorry to ask such a thing in this rain and in the late of the night. My master needs help, take this letter from my master. Take the north road from here and go to Svalich Woods. After that you will find my master in the VIllage of Barovia.” 1

[[Zaphi [[(Dilay)]]]]: You are in a shop to buy some bread. But you cannot afford it. A man behind you touches on your shoulder and asks to pay for your bread. … After paying, both of you go outside to talk a bit. He starts with saying “I know you had better days, and you are now desperately in need of some money. Help my master if you are a real man with honour. Take this letter. I want you to come to Village of Barovia where you’ll find my master. Take the east road and from there go to Svalich Woods. You’ll know when you are in the Village of Barovia” He doesn’t look back and leaves. 2

[[Krusk [[(Alper)]]]]: You are in a library under a gozlemevi. You are silently reading a book you found from one of the shelves. In an instant you see a man standing in front of you. “You seem a very knowledgeable person. My master needs you. Senin o bilgine efendimin en yakinindak birisini iyilestirmen icin ihyitacimiz var. If you are a man with real honor, you will come to my master to help us. Take this letter from my master. After that go south from this gozlemevi to reach the Svalich woods. After that continue into the Village of Barovia, there you will understand and find my master.” Leaves.
