- Backstory
    
    Eldon lived in the kingdom Luiren with his father, he doesn’t know what happened to his mom. Maybe she is still out there. His father was a professional flue player which all of Luiren loved. Eldon also had great talent but didn’t quite enjoy it. He spent all his time with his father, farming and playing the flute. He grew up a simple childhood, up until the age of 13. 
    
    When he was 13, Eldon pushed his father down the stairs while playing with him, which killed him. To not get executed by law and not be despised by everybody who listened to his music, he then covered it up by burning the house. When rescue came, the body was damaged and burnt beyond repair and the Monastery of Hin Fist took Eldon. Even after growing up, he stayed there and channeled all his energy to being the best monk possible, training from day to night to protect the people of Luiren even though the kingdom was not in real danger. It helped him to not think about what happened.
    
    When he was 42, a single mother of one disappeared while passing the Forest of Amtar while travelling to trade with the Dambrath nation. With this event, Eldon realized his guilt became too much and he took off. He also didn’t want the child to end up like him, to grow up without a parent. He also thought that communing with nature by himself could help him heal and get wiser. He left the monastery and took off to the forest and he swore an oath in front of Yondalla, the goddess of halflings, to not return to Luiren except when he finds the mother.
    
    He lived in seclusion: training, contemplating and struggling with carnivore plants such as assassin vines. Only rarely interacting with the mixed-race elves in the forest. After a while he discovered the rumors about portals here were true, and he saw all kinds of otherworldly things. His world sight was expanded and he experienced so much, but he could barely remember anything due to the number of things he has seen- also the portals fucked with his brain until years of getting accustomed to them.
    
    In the Forest of Amtar, he also found the Trunadar, the star people, who are actually a tribe of few wild elves in the forest and discovered the secret nature of stars. He is now a professional astrologist. One of the first things he read in the stars that he would soon “find what he was looking for”. The message seemed really vague but he persevered.
    
    After being alone for 36 years, he entered yet another portal which led to a deepspawn. It spawned a copy of the lost mother who seemed to slightly recall her children. As soon as Eldon moved to her, she took it as an attack on the deepspawn and charged at Eldon. He had no chance but to kill her, knocking her out with 3 blows of his quarterstaff, which then he slayed the deepspawn in a crying rage.
    
    After some time contemplating near the corpse of the dead mother, he realized that he had no option but to move on. No option but to wander the forgotten realms helping the people who needs him and looking for a purpose. He’d kind of dealt with his issues from his childhood during this hermitage, especially after dealing with the deepspawn and taking revenge on it. He took the food and the riches from the stash at the deepspawn’s lair. And hopped through the first portal he saw, and he never looked back.
