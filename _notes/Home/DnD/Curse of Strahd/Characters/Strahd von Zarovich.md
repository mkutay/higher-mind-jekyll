# Strahd von Zarovich

# Strahd’s Goals

- Turn Ireena Kolyana. She very much looks like Tatyana and for Strahd’s third visit (if happens) he is going to turn her to a vampire by killing her.
- Find Rudolp van Richten. Legendary vampire hunter. He wants to meet him and bring him to his castle to break his spirit.
- Search for a successor or consort. Most important one, if anyone enters to his layer, his focus shifts to them (the adventurers). Although at the end he determines that no one can replace him, at first he tries to find a successor. He plays close attention to adventurers who are **charismatic and arrogant**, like himself. If they withstand the attacks of Strahd, they will provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.

# Role Playing Strahd

- Doesn’t feel anything. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd’s humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him.
- Master of his own fate.
- He believes that Ireena’s body is the host for Tatyana’s soul, and Tatyana’s soul **belongs** to him.
- Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is **clever or attractive**.
- If there is no cohesion in a party, he preys on the **weakest**. He promises to help one at the expense of another. He doesn’t keep promises.

# When Strahd Attacks

- He travels everywhere, it is best that characters should meet him multiple times.
- When he wants to terrorize, he pays them a visit by an invitation from someone, along with his vampire spawn. Strahd doesn’t attack Ireena. These encounters are meant to **test** the characters, not kill them.
