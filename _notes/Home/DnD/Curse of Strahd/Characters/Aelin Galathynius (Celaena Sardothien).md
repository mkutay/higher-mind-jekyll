Aelin Galathynius was born to Laucian Galathynius and his wife, Valanthe Galathynius, in Orynth. For the first eight years of her life, she lived as the Princess of Terrasen. Aelin's Fae heritage manifested itself at an early age. She could shift between forms quite easily, though her fire control was less than exemplary. Her lack of control led to a deep-seated fear of her own powers, which was so intense that she considered it a relief when magic fell and she no longer had to fear herself. One night, the King of Adarlan decided to overthrow one of his major political opponents, the royal family of Terrasen, and to conquer their country for his own. Aelin discovered the deaths of her parents when she climbed into their bed thinking the wetness on the bed was due to rain coming in from the open window in their chamber and woke to a maid's screams to discover the bed was soaked with their blood. Her mother's dearest friend, Lady Marion Lochan, sacrificed herself to allow Aelin to escape and survive the massacre of her family. She fell into a river, and only Elena sacrificing herself to save her kept her alive. The King cemented his rule over Erilea by promoting across the country the deaths of the Terrasen nobility, all the while unaware of the survival of Aelin. After the deaths of her parents and Orlon, her uncle and King of Terrasen, she became the sole survivor of Terrasen's royal family. Arobynn Hamel, King of the Assassins, was led by Elena in a trance and found Aelin half frozen to death on the banks of the Florine River. He offered her a choice; to stay with him and be trained as a spy, entertainer, charlatan assassin or be cast off into the streets. Aelin chose the former and became an assassin, killing her first target at the age of nine. She was restyled as Celaena Sardothien to hide her true identity.
