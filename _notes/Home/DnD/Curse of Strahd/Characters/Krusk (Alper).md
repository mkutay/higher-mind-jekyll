- Backstory
    
    From birth I have been good with magic, when a was a little child master wizard in our local library took me to educate me. I have read nearly all books in that library. One day my master died because of natural causes, leaving me a ancient text about devils which I have not read to this day. I am travelling with this text in order to learn more about magic and to have some adventures in the way.
