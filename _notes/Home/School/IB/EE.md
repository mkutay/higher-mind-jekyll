# EE

mathamadics

1. Ask a question which you don't know how to solve. Don't get too attached to the question at this stage.
2. Start trying to figure out how that question is answered. The answers to most real-world questions are approximated using models which get better as you add more complex math, so there's likely to be one at a level of math just beyond what you know. That's what you're aiming for
3. If your question is too easy, you'll probably still be able to find related questions which are harder to answer. Similarly, if your question is too hard, you may still be able to find related questions (and cases) which are easier to answer.
4 - 7 are the same as Lake's guide

How I think you should start your Math EE (research based):

1. Settle on a topic and a general resarch direction. I think it is too early to settle on a final research question at this point, you don't have a good holistic understanding of the mathematical theory you're investigating.
2. Start trying to write and piece together ideas, it doesn't have to be logical or structured, only you have to be able to understand what it is.
3. While you are researching, you will see new research directions, pursue them. Look at if they are interesting and keep learning about them. Write some stuff about them and see if it makes sense.
4. When you're done with your research, you should have a ridiculous amount of research and random words written about things (hopefully well above 4000 words).
5. At this stage you should be able to identify what your research question is, because you now fully understand the mathematical field you are investigating.
6. Rewrite your entire essay, and reuse concepts which you already have research and writing about, but reorient all your work within the evaluative perspective of your chosen research question.
7. This is now your first draft.
- Originality in thought and interpretation is favored over originality in mathematics or application.
