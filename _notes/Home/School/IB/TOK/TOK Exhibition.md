# TOK Exhibition

1. What prompt did you pick? What scope did you pick? Do you have any idea how to answer it?
If you do, good! If you don't, then answer it.
2. Now, try and break down your answer into 3 parts. Try and come up with individual "topic statements", as if you were doing a Language A essay.
3. What do you think of when the topics brush by your head? Anything cross your mind? An approach some of my upperclassmen did was take random objects in their room and related it to their knowledge question.
4. Write a bunch of things down and see what they have in common. Then maybe look online for a "specific version" of that object, if you're going too general.
5. Once you finish all the above, you should have your objects.
