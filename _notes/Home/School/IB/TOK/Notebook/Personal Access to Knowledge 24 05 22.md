# Personal Access to Knowledge 24/05/22

(in your tok essay you should mention your personal experience that you got during the tok course)

- what are the primary things that are connected to you when it comes to access to knowledge?
    - personal beliefs
    - personal values
    - personal experience
    - your own ideologies

conformation bias: tendency that you look for things that are connected to your values.

if you are an atheist you probably won’t listen the to pope or imam. (conformation bias)

however, you should listen to them to learn new perspectives even you don’t change your beliefs.

you should get stuck on watching a single news channel even if you don’t agree with what they say you should watch all of them

- knowing is more important than knowledge, knowledge can be stored (books, files, brains), but understanding is what happens when you actively engage with knowledge.

## Memory

the sum of our knowledge is not in our conscious minds most of the time, but some of that knowledge can appear when we are thinking, talking, or writing. 

our memories and minds are not perfect

- every time we remember, our memories are reconstructed, and with each reconstruction, they are susceptible to change.
    - you saw a crime happen, later you are asked to describe what happened. you want to give a mindful and logical answer so you fill in the holes that you don’t know about. but the things that you said didn’t happened.
- our memories, along with our perceptions, are subject to our personal biases and moods.
    - if we retrieve a memory in a happy mood, we are more likely to remember that memory as happy, whereas even a memory of the happiest occasion can be darkened by recalling it when in a bad mood
- memory decay, loss of memory
    - you lose memory when you don’t use it often or for long times.

## Forgetfulness

inability to access knowledge from long term memory 

short term memory: in consciousness

long term memory: not in consciousness

inability reasons: stressed, losing concentration, forgetting a word, interference 

- absent-mindedness: is forgetfulness that happens if we do not pay enough attention to what we are doing
    - watching TV and reading a book at the same time, you won’t understand neither of them.
- blocking: when there is an obstruction to your ability to recall information, *tip of your tongue.*
- misattribution: to give credit to wrong person or source, whether deliberately or mistakenly.
    - you may even be absolutely certain that it came from one source and later discover that it come from another one.
    - **false memories** we are all vulnerable to having details inadvertently inserted into our memories through the power of suggestion. If you hear people talking about an event that you were at in the past, you can incorporate the details they discuss into your own memories, so that later, if asked to recall your memories of the event, you may also *remember* the added details as though they were your own.
    - Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer’s experiment
    - leading questions: a question that leaves you to think in a way.

## Ambiguity and Vagueness

- ambiguity: when a word, statement, image or situation can have more than one meaning or interpretation
- vagueness: when something is not clear os has no distinct boundaries, is imprecise and defies exact definition.

metaphors, ironies can create problems when accessing knowledge
