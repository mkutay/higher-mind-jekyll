# Chapter 3: periodic table

# periodic table today

![Untitled](Chapter%203%20periodic%20table/Untitled.png)

period: 1 → 7, rows, principle quantum number, n, energy level

left → right: atomic number increases, shell numbers doesn’t change

starts with 1A, ends with 8A

there are;

- 2 elements in the 1st period
- 8 elements in the 2nd and 3rd period
- 18 elements in the 4th and 5th period
- 32 elements in the 6th and 7th period

groups: 18 groups, 1A → 8A, 3B → 8B - 1B → 2B

elements in the same group have **similar** chemical properties

- 1A: alkaline metals
- 2A: alkaline earth metals
- 3A: earth metals
- 4A: carbon group metals
- 5A: nitrogen group metals - pnictogens
- 6A: oxygen group metals - chalcogens
- 7A: halogens - salt makers
- 8A: noble gases

---

- main group elements
    
    1st group (excluding H)
    
    2nd group
    
    group 13 → 18
    
- transition elements
    
    group 3 → 12 (not all of them → Zn is neither transition nor main group)
    

### periodic tables blocks

![Untitled](Chapter%203%20periodic%20table/Untitled%201.png)

- if an element wants be similar to He the element is doublet, otherwise octet

# metals

- they are shiny
- malleable
- reacts with O2 to form basic oxides
- high melting and boiling points, high density
- good conductors of heat and electricity
- solid at room temp (except Hg)
- form positive ions (forms ionic compounds with non-metals)
- active, half noble (Hg, Cu, Ag), noble (Au, Pt) metals

# non-metals

- brittle
- low melting and boiling points (except C), low density
- doesn’t conduct heat and electricity (except graphite)
- pos and neg ions
- covalent bounds with each other

# metalloids

- similar to metals as physical properties and similar to non-metals as chemical properties
- solid in room temp
- 7 metalloid elements (B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, At, Po)
- conducts heat and electricity less than metals, but more than non-metals
- electrical conductivity increases with temperature (they are used with other metals to increase conductivity in high temperatures [Au and Cu cannot conduct electricity at high temps])

# noble gases

- 8A group
- mono-atomic, colorless, stable gases
- very low melting and boiling points

# groupings in the periodic table

$n_1l_1^{{m_l}_1}\space \space n_2l_2^{{m_l}_2}$

max $l$: s, p → A groups; d, f → B groups

max $n$: period number

sum of $m_l$: group number

$^{}_5Be$: $[He]2s^22p^1$

p → A group

2 + 1: 3A group

2: 2nd period

$^{}_{25}Mn$: $[Ar]4s^23d^5$

d → B group

2 + 5 → 7B group

4: 4th period

$^{}_{26}Fe$, $^{}_{27}Co$, $^{}_{28}Ni$: 8B group

$^{}_{29}Cu$: 1B group

$^{}_{30}Zn$: 2B group

$^{}_{33}As$: $[Ar]4s^23d^{10}4p^3$

p → A group (d has all of its orbitals full

2 + 3: 5A group

4: 4th period

# transition metals

transition metals are B group elements - lanthanoids - actinoids - 2B

transition metal to IUPAC: an element that has an atom with an **incomplete d-sub level** or that gives rise to cations with an incomplete-sub level → **d block elements**

- d block elements
    
    between s and p blocks
    
    they share common characteristics between them → their d sub-level is being filled
    
    includes transition elements
    

# inner transition metals

the lanthanoids → elements from $Z=58$ to $Z=71$

the  actinoids → elements from $Z=90$ to $Z=103$

# periodic trends

elements show trends according to periods and groups

## atomic radius

- the bonding atomic radius
    
    distance between two nuclei of $X_2$ is given by $d$, and the **bonding atomic radius** is defined as $Rb=\frac{d}{2}$
    
    = covalent radius
    
- bonding atomic radius for metals
    
    for metals bonding atomic radius is $\frac{d}{2}$
    
- non bonding atomic radius
    
    **van der waal’s radius**
    
    argon → doesn’t form diatomic species → in solid state the atoms would touch each other → $Rnb = \frac{d}2$
    

### periodic trends in atomic radius

left → right, **in general** atomic radius decreases → proton number increases → gravitational pull increases

top → bottom, atomic radius increases → energy levels increase

- effective nuclear charge and screening effect
    
    electrons are attracted to the nucleus
    
    an outer-shell electron is also repelled by the other electrons
    
    the **core electrons** in the inner non-valence energy levels → reduce the positive nucleear charge experienced by a valence electron.
    
    **screening** or **shielding**
    
    ---
    
    net charge experienced by an electron → **effective nuclear charge** $Z_{eff}$ = nuclear charge ($Z$) minus the charge, $S$ (constant), that is shielded or screened by the core electrons: 
    
    $Z_{eff}=Z-S$
    

### periodic trends in ionic radius

- cations
    - cations are smaller than the atoms from which they come → there are more protons than electrons in the cation → the valence electrons are strongly attracted to the nucleus

## ionization energy

minimum energy required to remove an electron from neutral gaseous atom in its ground-state

- first IE: $IE_1+X_{(g)}\rarr X^+_{(g)}+e^-$
- second IE: $IE_2+X^+_{(g)}\rarr X^{+2}_{(g)} + e^-$
- $X+IE_1+IE_2\rarr X^{+2}_{(g)}+2e^-$
