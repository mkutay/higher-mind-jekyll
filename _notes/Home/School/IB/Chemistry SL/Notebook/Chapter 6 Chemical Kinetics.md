# Studying Reaction Rates

One of the main considerations when examining a chemical reaction is whether it will take place fast enough for it to be useful. Airbags in cars, oxidation of metals. 

## Rate Of Reaction

The change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time. Units: $\text{mol}\space\text{dm}^{-3}\space\text{s}^{-1}$.

## Experimental Measures Of Reaction Rates

$\Delta c$, the change in concentration, can be measured by monitoring a property that will change when the reactants are converted into products.

1. Change in pH (for acid-base reactions), pH probe and meter.
2. Change in conductivity (for reactions involving electrolytes or ions), conductivity probe and meter.
3. Change in mass or volume (for reactions involving solids or gases).
4. Change in colour (for reactions involving transition metals or other coloured compounds), colorimetry.

A graph of $t-c$ is plotted, the rate of reaction is the gradient of the tangential line at time $t$.

## Average Rate

$\text{average rate}=\frac{\Delta c}{\Delta t}$

$\Delta c$: change in concentration of reactant or product

$\Delta t$: time interval over which the change in concentration was measured

For gases, it also can be expressed as the change in volume: $\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}$

## Instantaneous Rate

$\lim_{\Delta t\rarr0}\frac{\Delta  c}{\Delta t}=\frac{\text{d}c}{\text{d}{t}}$

## Initial Rate

Instantaneous rate at $t=t_0=0$

## Rate Equation

$x\text{A}+y\text{B}\longrightarrow q\text{C}+p\text{D}$

$\text{rate}=-\frac{1}{x}\times \frac{\text{d}[\text{A}]}{\text{d}t}=
-\frac{1}{y}\times \frac{\text{d}[\text{B}]}{\text{d}t}=+\frac{1}{q}\times \frac{\text{d}[\text{C}]}{\text{d}t}=+\frac{1}{p}\times \frac{\text{d}[\text{D}]}{\text{d}t}$

## Kinetic Molecular Theory Of Gases

1. Large amounts of particles moving at high velocities in random directions.
2. Particles have masses but donâ€™t have volumes. The space between particles is much larger than the size of the particle.
3. Collisions between particles are elastic. Energy is transferred. 
4. The average kinetic energy is proportional to the absolute temperature. 

## Collision Theory

1. The two particle must collide with each other. There must be physical contact.
2. The colliding particles must have the correct mutual orientation.
3. The reacting particles must have sufficient kinetic energy to initiate the reaction.

$E_\text{a}$ is the minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur. 

## Catalysts

A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction, but is not consumed. A catalyst provides an alternative pathway for the reaction and lowers the $E_{\text{a}}$.

### Homogeneous Catalysts

A homogeneous catalyst is in the same physical phase or state as the reactants.

### Heterogeneous Catalysts

A heterogeneous catalyst is in a different physical phase or state as the reactants.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Energy Distribution And Temperature

### Maxwell-Boltzmann Energy Distribution Curve

A particles velocity constantly changes. And the distribution of velocities of the particles must be considered.

## Factors That Affect The Rate Of A Chemical Reaction

1. Increasing the temperature at which the reactions is conducted
2. Addition of a catalyst
3. Increasing the concentration of the reactants
4. Decreasing the particle size of reactants in the solid phase: increasing the surface area.
