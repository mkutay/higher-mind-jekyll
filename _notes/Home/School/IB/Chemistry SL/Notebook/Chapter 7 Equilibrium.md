# Chapter 7: Equilibrium

Many chemical reactions are reversible and exist in a state of equilibrium. Understanding of equilibrium enables chemists to control reaction conditions and maximize the yield of the desired product. In a closed system the concentration of liquid and gas does not change, but molecules are constantly being interconverted between the two phases. 

$\text{H}_2\text{O}_{\text{(l)}}\rightleftharpoons \text{H}_2\text{O}_{\text{(g)}}$

**Heterogeneous equilibrium and solubility:** When the salt and water solution becomes saturated, the rate of dissolving will equal the rate of precipitation and a dynamic equilibrium will be established.

# Chemical Systems

At equilibrium: 

- The forward and reverse reactions are occurring at equal rates.
- There is no change in the concentration of reactants and products.
- There is no change in macroscopic properties such as colour and density.
- The equilibrium can be approached from either the forward or reverse direction.
- The equilibrium is dynamic. The forward and reverse reactions continue but no overall change in the concentration of reactants and products occur.
- Any changes in the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure or concentration of reactants or products, can affect the equilibrium, demonstrating its dynamic nature.

# The equilibrium law

$N_2O_4\rightleftharpoons 2NO_2$

$K_c = \frac{[NO_2]^2}{[N_2O_4]}$

The value of the equilibrium constant is specific for each chemical reaction at a given temperature. Values of $K_c$ have no units. If $K_c$ is a very large number, products are favoured over reactants. A very small $K_c$ means that reaction is unfavourable.

| Change in reaction equation | Equilibrium constant expression | Equilibrium constant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reverse the reaction | inverse of the expression | $\frac{1}{K_c}$ |
| halve the coefficients | square root of the expression | $\sqrt{K_c}$ |
| double the coefficients | square the expression | $K_c^2$ |
| sum equations | product of the expressions |  |

The value of $K_c$ remains constant unless the temperature changes.

> If a change is made to a system that is in equilibrium, the balance between the forward and reverse reactions will shift to offset this change and return the system to equilibrium.

| Type of reaction | Change in temperature | Equilibrium position | Equilibrium constant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| exothermic | increase | moves to the left, favouring reactants | decreases |
| exothermic | decrease | moves to the right, favouring products | increases |
| endothermic | increase | moves to the right, favouring products | increases |
| endothermic | decrease | moves to the left, favouring reactants | decreases |

The addition of catalysts does not affect the equilibrium constant.

| $Q>K_c$ | The concentration of products is greater than at equilibrium and the reverse reaction is favoured until equilibrium is reached. |
| --- | --- |
| $Q<K_c$ | The concentration of reactants is greater than at equilibrium and the forward reaction is favoured until equilibrium is reached. |
| $Q=K_c$ | The system is at equilibrium and the forwardd and reverse reactions occur at equal rates. |
