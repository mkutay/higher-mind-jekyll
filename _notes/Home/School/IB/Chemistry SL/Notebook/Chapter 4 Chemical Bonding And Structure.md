**************************The Octet Rule:************************** Elements tend to lose electrons, gain electrons, or share electrons in order to acquire a noble gas core electron configuration.

# Covalent Bonding

************************************************Electrostatic attraction************************************************ between a ******************shared pair of electrons****************** and *****************the positively charged nuclei*****************.

The lewis structure of a compound can be found by finding it’s valance electron number, stable electron number and bonding number.

More bond number between two atoms = more strength. 

Less bond number between two atoms = long bond length

## ****************************Bond Polarity****************************

| Bond Type | $\Delta \chi_p$ |
| --- | --- |
| ionic | $\Delta \chi_p > 1.8$ |
| pure covalent (non-polar) | $\Delta \chi_p = 0$ |
| polar covalent | $0<\Delta \chi_p\leq1.8$ |

# Covalent Structures

Show **bonding pairs of electrons** and **non-bonding pairs of electrons** in the lewis structure.

**Resonance structures** should be wrote out too. 

Don’t forget to show the **coordinate covalent bond** with an arrow.

## VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion)

Since electrons are negatively charged subatomic particles, **pairs of electrons repel one another to be as far apart as possible in space**.

## Molecular Polarity

Is the molecule itself polar or non-polar? Find bond polarity of each bond and represent them as vectors. By using vector addition, sum all the dipole moments present, if there is net dipole moment, the molecule is polar, otherwise the molecule is non-polar.

## Allotropes

Allotropes are different structural modifications of the same element and can vary in both physical and chemical properties. Carbon’s allotropes: graphite, diamond, graphene, and $C_{60}$ fullerene. 

### Covalent Network Solids

The atoms are held together by covalent bonds in a giant 3D lattice structure (in large networks or chains). $SiO_2$, silicon dioxide or quartz. $C_{60}$ fullerene is molecular.

- High melting points.
- Typically insoluble in common solvents.
- They are generally hard, graphite is soft.
- They are poor electrical conductors, graphite and graphene are exceptions.

### Graphite

Layers of hexagonal rings consisting of carbon atoms. Layers are connected by ******************************************************weak intermolecular forces****************************************************** of attraction (London). Each carbon atom adopts a ******************************trigonal planar****************************** geometry, and is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms at a bond angle of $120º$. The coordination number of each carbon atom is $3$. Layers can slide past each other, and thus graphite can be used as **lubricant**. As it has delocalized $\pi$ electrons, it is a good conductor of electricity. 

### Diamond

Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a **********************************************tetrahedral arrangement**********************************************, with a $C-C-C$ bond angle of $109.5º$. The coordination number between carbon atoms is $4$. Diamond is one of the hardest substances known because of this *covalently bonded interlocking structural arrangement of tetrahedra*. Melting and boiling points are very high, and it cannot conduct electricity (valence electrons are localized in the single $\sigma$ covalent bonds.

### Graphene

Thinnest and strongest of known materials, first 2D crystal. Like graphite it is a covalent network solid, unlike graphite it consists of a single planar sheet of carbon atoms arranged hexagonally, and is only **one atom thick**. Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms and has a coordination number of $3$. They are densely packed in a honeycomb crystalline lattice but the lattice is planar. Graphene is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor.

When the graphene sheet is rolled up, it forms a ******************************carbon nanotube******************************. And when it is folded up into a sphere it becomes a ******************fullerene******************.

### $C_{60}$ Fullerene

It is like a soccer ball and it has 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal surfaces. Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three others and the coordination number is $3$. However, the arrangement is not planar.

$C_{60}$ fullerene is not a covalent network solid, and it is composed of **individual molecules** with strong covalent bonds, but with weak London forces between the molecules.

They are black solids that do not dissolve in water, but can dissolve in some non-polar solvents. They do contain delocalized electrons, but they cannot conduct electricity as the electron cannot move to the other molecule.

Fullerenes are basically **inclusion complexes**.

### Silicon Dioxide, $SiO_2$ (Quartz)

**Amorphous form**, (a solid with no ordered structure). It is a 3D covalent network solid. It consists of arrays of $SiO_4$ tetrahedra arranged in a lattice. Each silicon atom is covalently bonded to four oxygen atoms, and each oxygen atom is covalently bonded to two silicon atoms. The $Si-O-Si$ geometrical arrangement is bent because of the presence of two non-bonding pairs of electrons on each oxygen atom. It has high melting and boiling point. Is not soluble in water and cannot conduct electricity (molten form can conduct though)

# Intermolecular Forces

******************************************Intramolecular Forces****************************************** are attraction forces between the atoms inside a molecule. 

********************************************Intermolecular Forces******************************************** are attraction forces between the molecules.

- London forces (induced dipole-induced dipole forces)
- Dipole-dipole forces
- Hydrogen bonding

London (dispersion) forces + dipole-dipole forces + dipole-induced dipole forces = ****************************************van der Waals forces****************************************

Relative strengths of these forces are:

- London forces < dipole-dipole forces < hydrogen bonds

## London Forces

Exists in all molecules.

Normally $H_2$ gas molecules has a symmetrical electron cloud. However, if you were to take a random snapshot at a given instant of time one part of the molecule might have slightly more electron density than another part: ******************************************************Instantaneous dipole******************************************************. 

![[/Screen Shot 2022-12-25 at 14.15.22.png]]

****************************Polarizability:**************************** The ease of distortion of the electron cloud of a molecular entity by an electric field (such as that caused by the proximity of a charged particle). Because the mobile electrons can be dispersed, the repulsion between regions of electron density can be minimized. Therefore, the orbital can effectively change its shape, which results in a non-spherical distribution of the electron cloud; that is the orbital is pulled out of its symmetrically spherical shape. A temporary dipole is generated that results in electrostatic attractions between the partial positive charge, $\delta^+$, of one hydrogen molecule and the partial negative charge, $\delta^-$, of the neighboring hydrogen molecule.

In the next instant of time a different pattern of induced dipoles may occur.

*******************What affects the magnitude of London Forces?*******************

Number of electrons, size of the electron cloud, shapes of molecules.

### Number Of Electrons

The greater the number of electrons, the larger the distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus. Thus the electron cloud can be polarized more easily.

- Example
    
    $Ne_{10}$ and $Kr_{36}$. The **London forces in krypton are stronger**, so the boiling and melting point of krypton is higher than that of neon.
    

### Size (Volume) Of the Electron Cloud

In a large electron cloud, the attraction of electrons to the nucleus will not be as great as in a smaller electron cloud, thus London forces of a large electron cloud will be higher.

- Example
    
    Propane, $CH_3CH_2CH_3$, and octane, $CH_3(CH_2)_6CH_3$. The number of carbon atoms in octane is greater than in propane. Which results in stronger London forces.
    

### Shapes Of Molecules

If a molecule can easily touch another molecule it’s London force’s attraction is higher. 

- Example
    
    Pentane, $C_5H_{12}$, and 2,2-dimethylpropane, $(CH_3)_4C$. Pentane has higher boiling point. There is a large contact area across the entire molecule for adjacent molecules to interact.
    

## Dipole-Dipole Forces

Exists in all polar molecules with a permanent dipole moment. There is an attraction between the positive end of one ********************************permanent dipole******************************** and the negative end of ******************************************************************another permanent dipole on an adjacent molecule.******************************************************************

![[/Screen Shot 2022-12-25 at 14.39.43.png]]

- Example
    
    $ICl$ and $Br_2$. Since $ICl$ is highly polar, in addition to London forces it also has dipole-dipole forces of attraction between the molecules. Which leads to a higher boiling point.
    

## Hydrogen Bonding

Between one of the $F$, $O$, $N$ elements and $H$. It may be depicted as:

$X-H \overbrace{\cdot\cdot\cdot}^{\text{hydrogen bond}} Y-Z$

- Hydrogen donor is $X-H$.
- Hydrogen acceptor may be an atom or an anion, $Y$, a fragment or a molecule $Y-Z$ in which $Y$ is bonded to $Z$

Hydrogen bonds may occur between

![[/Screen Shot 2022-12-25 at 14.45.27.png]]

************Note:************ The $H-F$, $O-H$, and $N-H$ bonds are polar covalent bonds and are not hydrogen bonds.

![[/Screen Shot 2022-12-25 at 14.51.51.png]]

$NH_3$, $HF$, $H_2O$ have hydrogen bonds between their molecules and have higher boiling points than their group, however $CH_4$ does not have hydrogen bond.

# Metallic Bonding

The structure of a metal is a regular giant lattice that consists of positive ions surrounded by a ***sea*** of delocalized electrons. Such that the definition is that a metallic bond is the electrostatic attraction between a lattice of positive ions and delocalized electrons (they can move throughout the entire lattice).

The strength of a metallic bond depends on:

- The number of valence electrons that can become delocalized.
- The charge of the metal ion.
- The ionic radius of the metallic positive ion. If it is smaller the bond strength is larger.

Metals are good electrical conductors as they have delocalized electrons throughout their lattice.

Metals are malleable and it is connected to metallic character (opposite of metallic bond) of such metal. (If the metallic character is higher, the malleability is higher).

## Alloys

An alloy is a mixture that consists either of two or more metals, or of a metal combined with an alloying element composed of one or more non-metals. Alloys have enhanced properties such as strength, hardness and durability.
