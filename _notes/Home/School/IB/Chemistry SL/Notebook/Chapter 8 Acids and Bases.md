# Chapter 8: Acids and Bases

# Theories of Acids and Bases

## Arrhenius’s Theory

- He defined acid as a substance that ionizes in water to produce hydrogen ions.
- An alkali produces hydroxide ions.
- Combination of acid and base, neutralization reaction: $H^++OH^-\longrightarrow H_2O$
- Cannot explain, $NH_3+HCl\longrightarrow NH_4Cl$. Because $NH_3$ doesn’t have hydroxide ions.

## Brønsted-Lowry’s Theory

- Acid as a proton donor and base as a proton acceptor. Proton: $H^+$ or $H_3O^+$
- $H_2CO_3+OH^-\rightleftarrows HCO_3+H_2O$: Here carbonic acid is conjugate acid 1 and bicarbonate is conjugate base 1.

## Amphiprotic Species

- The water molecule can accept and donate a hydrogen ion to act like both acid and base.

# Properties of Acids and Bases

| Acids | Bases |
| --- | --- |
| taste sour | taste bitter |
| pH < 7 | pH > 7 |
| litmus is red | litmus is blue |
| phenolphthalein is colourless | phenolphthalein is pink |
| methyl orange is red | methyl orange is yellow |

$\text{acid}+\text{metal}\longrightarrow \text{salt}+\text{hydrogen}$

$\text{acid}+\text{metal carbonate/metal hydrogencarbonate}\longrightarrow \text{salt}+\text{carbon dioxide} + \text{hydrogen}$

# The pH Scale

$\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]$

$[H+]=10^{-\text{pH}}$

- Strong acids and bases fully ionize.

## Ionization of Water

- Auto-ionization: $H_2O\leftrightarrows H^++OH^-$
- $K_c=\frac{[H^+][OH^-]}{[H_2O]}$, concentration of water is constant, $K_w=[H^+][OH^-]=10^{-14}$.
- In pure water, $[H^+]=[OH^-]=10^{-7}$.

# Strong and Weak Acids and Bases

- The strength of an acid and base depends on the degree to which it ionizes or dissociates in water.
- Conductivity of acids and bases in aqueos solutions can be used to determine the strength of acids and bases.

# Acid Deposition

- It is the process by which acid-forming pollutants are deposited on the Earth’s surface. Deforestation, the leaching of minerals, elevated acid levels in lakes and rivers…
- Rain is slightly acidic: $CO_2+H_2O\leftrightarrows H_2CO_3$.
- Acid rains is more acidic than normal rain: NO, SO2, NO2.

$-\log_{10}K_a=\text{p}K_a$,  $K_a=10^{-\text{p}K_a}$

$-\log_{10}K_b=\text{p}K_b$,  $K_b=10^{-\text{p}K_b}$

- Buffer solution: weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjuaget acid.
- A lewis acid is a lone pair acceptor, a lewis base is a lone pair donor.
