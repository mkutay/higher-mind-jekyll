# C.1. Energy Sources

## Energy sources: quality and efficiency

What makes a good energy source? Contains large potential energy that can be released, at a reasonable rate, to a useful form with minimal pollution. 

If the conversion is too fast a large quantity of energy is dispersed, too slow and it is not useful. Like the combustion of glucose, the same amount of energy is released in a bomb calorimeter as in a human body. The slow rate of oxidation in the human body allows it to convert to a useful form whereas the rapid oxidation disperses energy too quickly and lowers the quality.

The “quality of energy” has different meanings. Cost per unit energy or efficiency of its conversion. Efficiency of coal is 30%, meaning 30% of available thermal energy produced from burning coal becomes electricity. According to IEA cost of obtaining electricity from coal is 7% less than gas and 19% less than nuclear sources.

The International Energy Agency ensures reliable, affordable, and clean energy.

All energy conversions undergo some sort of quality degradation as it turns into heat. And useful work diminishes. The more quality energy is degraded, the less efficient the fuel is. 

$\text{efficiency of energy transfer}=\frac{\text{useful output energy}}{\text{total input energy}}\times 100\%$

Distribution of energy is known as **************entropy**************. The more different ways energy can be distributed, higher the entropy, and less energy is available to do useful work.

## Energy density and specific energy

$\text{energy density}=\frac{\text{energy released from fuel}}{\text{volume of fuel consumed}}$ (do not have a negative value)

$\text{specific energy}=\frac{\text{energy released from fuel}}{\text{mass of fuel consumed}}$

(a worked example is in da book)

## Renewable energy resources

Renewable or green energy resources include solar energy, wind energy, biomass, water, geothermal energy, and fuel cells. Geothermal is one of the more widely used ones (cost per kilowatt-hour is high).
