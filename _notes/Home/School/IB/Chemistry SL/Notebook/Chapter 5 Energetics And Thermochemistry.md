# Measuring Energy Changes

****************************Thermodynamics**************************** is the study of energy and how it is inter-converted. The first law of thermodynamics, **law of conservation of energy**, states that energy can be neither created or destroyed; it can only be converted between different forms.

## Chemical Potential Energy, Heat, and Entropy

Chemical potential energy is stored in chemical bonds of reactants and products. ********Heat********, $q$, is a form of energy that is transferred from a warmer body to a cooler body, as a result of temperature gradient. Heat has the ability to do ********work********. As heat transfers to an object, the average kinetic energy of its particles is increased. At absolute zero 0 K, all motion of the particles stops and the **************entropy**************, $S$, of a system reaches minimum value. Temperature (K) is proportional to average kinetic energy.

### Chemical Energy

In an **********************open system********************** the transfer of matter and energy is possible across its boundary. A **************************closed system************************** allows no transfer of matter, though energy may be transferred across the boundary. In an ********************************isolated system********************************, matter can neither enter nor exit, but can only move inside.

- Bond breaking is an **********************endothermic********************** process.
- Bond creation is an ********************exothermic******************** process. This energies are termed **bond dissociation energy**.

## Enthalpy And Thermochemistry

****************Enthalpy**************** is an example of a ****************************state function****************************. For a state function any change in value is independent of the pathway between the initial and final measurements. 

$\Delta T=T_{final}-T_{initial}$

******************************Thermochemistry****************************** is the study of heat changes that occur during chemical reactions. At constant pressure, the change in enthalpy $\Delta H$ is defined as the heat transferred by a closed system during a chemical reaction. (kJ)

A **********************calorimeter********************** is any apparatus used to measure the amount of heat being exchanged with the surroundings. 

$\Delta H$ depends on Temperature, Pressure, Mass, State of matter, Type of matter.

### Endothermic And Exothermic Reactions

************************Endothermic:************************ Heat is transferred from the surroundings to the system. Positive enthalpy.

- When the state of matter changes to more unstable state. Solid → Liquid.
- Combustion of $N$.
- Analysis reaction. $CaCO_3\rightarrow CaO+CO_2$.
- Ionization energy is always endothermic. $X_{(g)}\rightarrow X^++e^-$.
- First electron affinity of $N$, noble gases and metals are endothermic.
- Second electron affinity is always endothermic. $X^-+e^2\overbrace{\rightarrow}^{\text{energy}}X^-$.
- Bond breaking is endothermic.
- Solids solubility is generally endothermic.

**Exothermic:** Heat is transferred from the system to the surroundings. Negative enthalpy. 

- Gas → Liquid.
- Combustion reactions except $N_2$ are exothermic. $CH_4+O_2\rightarrow CO_2+H_2O+\text{energy}$.
- Combination/synthesis reactions are exothermic. $KCl+O_2\rightarrow KClO_3+\text{heat}$.
- Acid-base reactions are exothermic.
- First electron affinity of non-metals are exothermic.
- Bond formation is exothermic.
- Gas solution solubility is always exothermic.

$E_a$ is the minimum energy required to start a reaction (activation energy). Exothermic reactions can continue with one activation energy. Endothermic reactions need energy to continue.

Specific heat capacity is an **************************intensive property************************** that does not vary in magnitude with the size of the system. 

Specific heat capacity is used to calculate the heat $q$ of a system using the relationship:

$q=mc\Delta T$ and $\Delta H=-q$

The value of $q$  can be calculated with a calorimeter cup. However, calorimeter cups are often not isolated and thus they will tell a lower $q$ than the real one. This can be overcome by looking at the cooling section of the curve after the reaction is complete, and extrapolate this back to the point of introduction to the reactant.

********************************************Molar enthalpy change******************************************** is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a reactant is used in a chemical reaction. 

The ****************************************************************************standard enthalpy change of a reaction**************************************************************************** $\Delta H_{298}^{\ominus}$ is determined at temperature 298 K and pressure 100 kPa with all species in their standard state. 

### Enthalpy Change Of Formation

The change in enthalpy during a reaction can be determined using the following equation:

$\Delta H^{\ominus}\text{reaction}=\Sigma(\Delta H_f^\ominus\text{products})-\Sigma(\Delta H_f^\ominus\text{reactants})$

$\Delta H_f^\ominus$ is the **standard enthalpy change of formation** of a substance. This is the energy change upon the formation of 1 mole of a substance from its constituent elements in their standard state. Reactants must be elements and products must contain one mole of a compound.

### Enthalpy Change Of Combustion

The ****************************************************************************standard enthalpy change of combustion**************************************************************************** $\Delta H_c^\ominus$ is the hat evolved upon the complete combustion of 1 mole of a substance. 

Instead of writing enthalpy separately, it is possible to write it with the equation.

$C_4H_{10}+\frac{13}{2}O_2\rightarrow4CO_2+5H_2O+2878 \space\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$

# Hess’s Law

A chemical equation usually shows the net reaction - it is a summary of a number of different reactions, which when added together result in an overall reaction.

Hess’s law is an application of the conservation of energy law: 

> Regardless of the route by which a chemical reaction proceeds, the enthalpy change will always be the same providing the initial and final states of the system are the same.
> 

# Bond Enthalpy

The **************************bond enthalpy************************** of a bond is defined as the energy required to break 1 mole of bonds in gaseous covalent molecules under standard conditions. Bond enthalpy is also referred to as ****************************************************bond dissociation enthalpy****************************************************. 

Bond enthalpies are derived from experimental data involving the breaking of the same bond found in a wide variety of compounds. The chemical environment changes and the bond enthalpy doesn’t take into account of intermolecular forces. These limitations are not considered to be significant though. 

As bond length increases, bond strength decreases. As bond polarity increases bond strength increases too. 

$\Delta H^\ominus=\Sigma(\text{BE bonds broken})-\Sigma(\text{BE bonds formed})$

Reaction enthalpy is always same with every method. However, when calculating the enthalpy change using bond enthalpy values, it should be in gaseous state, and they are approximations of the true values.

## Ozone

Examination of this energy profile reveals that the oxygen molecule and oxygen atom have a greater combined energy than the reactant ozone molecule. The products of this reaction are said to be less stable, as they exist at a higher energy.
