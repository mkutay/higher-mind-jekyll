# HL IO (the woman warrior)

- context: the text: Fa Mu Lan, like other “talk stories” it balances truth and fiction very well
    - the original story about Mu Lan, tells the tale of a young woman who takes her father’s place in battle, disguised as a man.

now lets go through the text paragraph by paragraph

- in the first paragraph the old man says “you can go pull sweet potatoes, or you can stay with us” which i think says how in that time what woman did was pulling sweet potatoes and cooking and that type of stuff.
- in the second paragraph the old woman tries to sway Mu Lan to be a fighter and be a hero to her village. and she actually accepts the offer of the old couple. i think the motivation behind her action is that she doesn’t want to pull sweet potatoes or cook for everyone, but she wants to make a change and don’t want to be the *normal* woman.
- for the next paragraphs we can see how the old people train her as a warrior. they are teaching or even forcing her to train. for instance, being quiet and staying still and not moving, she was in heavy training and couldn’t breathe. and i think she was enjoying all of this and not hating to train and fight. like putting in the effort to be different from other woman
- in the last paragraph we can see that she trained for five years and got strong. she is like a man, like a fighter and a warrior. now she has the ability to take a life and the ability to give birth to a child. these dual abilities and powers enable her to maintain both her sense of womanhood and her duties as a wife and mother.

with her fighter and warrior capabilities, now she is not like any other woman. now she rejects the only things her parents think women are capable of: pulling sweet potatoes or cleaning the dishes. now she is not dependent on men and her feet is not bound to her husband.
