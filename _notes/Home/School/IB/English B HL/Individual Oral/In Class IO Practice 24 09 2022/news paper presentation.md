- research: 25% of teenagers think playing computer games is exercise
    - what counts as a computer game?
        - do you need to be sitting down?
        - does it need to be played with a mouse and keyboard or a controller
        - we can list computer games into two categories in the context of exercises
            1. games that you play while you are sitting
                1. games to this category are games that you play with mouse and keyboard, but a point is that there are standing desks and you can play games while you are standing and doing exercise/stuff with your feet; a research: people doing stuff while standing can increase their productivity → this also applies to gaming where you might get higher win rate
            2. games that you play while you are standing
                1. lets put the point i made aside, more popular games in this category are VR games, where you need to be standing/walking/even running. 
                2. if anyone heard about WII games, there is a game that you can play virtual tennis with other people using a joy-con type thing, which you sweat a lot. 
- now we categorized types of computer games now lets talk about them being an exercise or not
    - first of all the second category that i mentioned: playing games while you are not sitting can count as exercises, and i want to give an example to this. the game i want to mention is a game called, beat saber. maybe some of you heard about this game, so to explain it in short terms, in this game you use a VR headset and play it while standing. in the game you have two light sabers and you use these to karate chop blocks in the game. but there’s a catch: you karate chop these blocks to a *rhythm*, thats why it is called *beat* saber. you can actually loose a lot of calories while playing this game.
    - i mentioned this but now lets talk about it in more detail: what about using a standing desk, as i said you can increase your productivity while standing and this is true for games. however i dont think that we can count this as *real* exercise as you just do not do any movement other than shifting your legs time to time.
    - other than playing games while standing, now lets talk about playing them while sitting, this is definitely not an exercise, like you are literally sitting there is no movement going on, maybe you move your mouse a lot but is that actually exercise?

other than that i think i counted most of the games so in conclusion i don’t think most of the games are exercise, of course there are exceptions as i mentioned like beat saber
