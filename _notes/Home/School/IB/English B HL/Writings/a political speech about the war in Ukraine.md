    Ladies, gentleman, and everybody in between today I am here to discuss with you about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia officially started the invasion on the 24th of February 2022. However, this war did not start that cold night. The war between Ukraine and Russia was going and is still going for decades and centuries.
    
    One of my friends showed me a photograph. In the photograph there was her family coming to America from Ukraine more than 100 years ago. They are Ukranian Jews fleeing the hate and anti-Semitism of the region.  These Ukrainian Jews were her grandfather and grandmother, and her parents (great greats). They all escaped the Pogrom ravaged Yelizavetgrad which is now Kiravograd, the center of Ukraine, and came to New Haven for a new life.  Her story is very familiar to many refugee families of the world, to many people victimized by war, hatred, bullying and crazy geopolitics.
    
    The story that she mentioned has a direct relationship to the war now because her family was forced to leave Ukraine by a Russian Pogrom against Jewish people, and I think everyone here can agree that a Pogrom is a genocidal invasion. Her family was just one of millions and millions of Jewish people who had to vacate because of hate, violence, depraved values and the madness of geopolitics which has not been stable for such a long time.
    
    Putin is a pathetic, corrupt and patriotic bully. And Ukraine was an easy target and he knows this too. The egg has already cracked. We all know that the most difficult thing to do in a war is once the guns are out, it is hard to put them away.
    
    This kind of geopolitical madness is not used only by Russia, The U.S. has used it for decades. For example, Grenada in 1983, or Panama, 1989-90? Innocent people were the casualties of some mad agenda then as well. Putin has used this notion of the U.S. protecting its own turf to justify his incursion into Ukraine. This justification is absolutely wrong.
    
    Dear Fellows, people, innocent people, are leaving Ukraine now and don’t want to leave. People are being killed and wounded. People just want to live their lives, raise their children, water their plants, make great art, and live a dignified life of happiness.
    
    Whatever Putin says there is no justification for this war to continue on. Thousands of people are getting killed as we talk. This is not how things are supposed to be and we all know it. Even the soldiers fighting on Russia’s side don't want any war.
    
    So, let us wage a global struggle against war, bullying and patriotism. Contact your representatives in Congress to let them know your concerns about the war. Fight against misinformation and not spread it. You can also protest about it in your streets and let your voice be heard.
    
    Dear Friends, it is now your time to do great things. If we all do great things we can end this war together.
