# Chapter 3: Analysing Data And Quantifying Randomness: Statistics And Probability

# Sampling

Qualitative Data: happy, sad, down. Not a number.

Quantitative Data: 2, 3, 4. A number.

Discrete Quantitative Data: integers. Number of DP students.

Continuous Quantitative Data: measurements. Height.

Population: every member of a group.

Sample: subset of a population.

---

Target Population: the population that is wanted to taken a sample from. All the apartments in the block.

Sampling Frame: list of people from which you can take your sample. Itemized list of individual apartments.

Sampling Unit: a single member that is chosen to be sampled. Each apartment.

Sampling Variable: characteristic wanted to be measured from each sampling unit. Number of people who live in the apartment.

Sampling Values: possible values which sampling variable can take. 0, 1, 2, 3.

## Sampling Techniques

Simple Random Sampling (SRS): Each member of a population has an equal chance of being selected. 

Systematic Sampling: Selecting a sample according to a random starting point and a fixed interval. Every 10th person of a 100 person population.

Stratified Sampling: Dividing the population into ****strata****. They are formed based on members shared characteristics.

Quota Sampling: Taking a sample size from each strata in proportion to the size of the population.

Convenience Sampling: You select members of a population that are more easily accessible.

## Dealing With Bias In Sampling

Bias: concluding some incorrect statistical information. Tends to give a skewed interpretation.

Sources of bias can include:

Some members of the population begin excluded from the sampling frame.

Non-response.

Bad design.

Bias by the respondent

## Reliability Of Data

Data is reliable if you can repeat a survey and get similar results.

Data is sufficient if there is enough data to support your claims.

Collect data that are representative, they represent the whole population well.

Two factors which may lead to unreliable data.

1. Missing Data
    - A lack of response to surveys.
    - Not being able to record data.
    - Do not put “not available” answers for selection.
    - Don’t put questions that are only apply to some people.
2. Errors in handling data.

# Descriptive Statistics

## Measures of central tendency

What is occurring in the middle of the data set. The mode, the mean, the median.

### Arithmetic Mean.

$X = {\sum_{i = 1}^{k} f_ix_i \over n}$, mean of a data set.

If it is the whole population then, $\mu = {\sum_{i = 1}^{k} f_ix_i \over n}$.

### Mode

The mode is the value which occurs most frequently. Value is mode, frequency is modal.

### Median

Middle value when the data is sorted.

if $n$  is odd, then $n + 1 \over 2$th term is the median.

if $n$ is even, then mean of $n \over 2$ and ${n \over 2} + 1$th terms is the median.

## Measures of dispersion

What is happening to the spread of the data set.

### Range

$\text{range} = x_{max} - x_{min}$

### Quartiles

First quartile, lower quartile or $Q_1$, has 25% of the data below it.

Second quartile is the median. 50% of the data lies below and above it.

Third quartile, upper quartile or $Q_3$, has 75% of data below it.

$Q_1 = {n + 1 \over 4}$th term

$Q_3 = 3{n + 1 \over 4}$th term

Interquartile range is $Q_3 - Q_1$

## Histograms

Grouped frequency table. If it is continuous draw a histogram.

the class $18 < x \leq 20$ has a class width of 2, $20-18=2$.

## Frequency histograms for discrete data

Vertical line graph

---

When examining a histogram plot look for

Centre: mean, median and mode.

Spread: range, max, min.

Outliers: a data item which is more than 1.5*IQR above the upper quartile, or less than 1.5*IQR below the lower quartile

Shape: unimodal, bimodal, mulitmodal/ symmetric, skewed (left-positive)

******Relative frequency******: the proportion of the data set belonging in the given class interval. $f\over n$.

## Histograms with unequal class widths

wider classes when the data is sparse (edges), narrow classes when it is dense (middle)
